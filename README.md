XYZ

Here is just a very basic coordinates plugin for the new API.

going through the process of learning PHP and the new API, so I figured I'd grab the lowest hanging fruit ;)

If anyone wants to view it the source is available on the documentation page.



I may implement some other features such as:

Log/Recall 10 Coordinates:

`/xyz save <0-9> - store current coordinates`

`/xyz <0-9> - recall stored coordinates`

Death Coordinates:

`/xyz death - will recall coordinates where you last died`

Get User Coords for Ops:

`/xyz get <username>`

Need to learn yml or sqlite save/read functions first and more about permission structures and how to tie in methods.

Hope you enjoy.

cheers, -u.
